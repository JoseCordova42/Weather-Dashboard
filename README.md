# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Application is used primarily for checking current weather of a given location and its forecast for the next five days. The user can search for a particular city in the top left searchbar or pick from a list of suggestions under said searchbar. Either choice will result in the main card displaying the city's name, today's date, a weather icon, current temperature in farenheit, humidity, and wind speed in miles per hour. Either choice will also result in the 5 blocks at the bottom displaying another weather icon, the temperature, and humidity of the next five days.
